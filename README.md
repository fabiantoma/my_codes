Welcome!
Let me introduce myself.
I am Tamas Fabian I am junior webdeveloper.
I have always been interested in programming, even as a young child. I find this field of work very challenging.
In summer 2019, I got the opportunity to work with programming when I started my IT studies at Checpoint-It Education Center in Szeged.
My goals are to improve professionally and to be a member of a dynamic team where I can learn more and contribute to the success of the company.
Currently I am a platoon leader at the Hungarian Defence Forces.
During my services abroad I had the opportunity to use both spoken and written English on a daily basis.
This page contains my works.
It has a few folders like javascript,php,mysqli.
